          <p>
            Khaled Hosseini, born in 1965 in Kabul, Afghanistan, is a novelist
            whose powerful storytelling delves into the complexities of human
            emotions and the turbulent history of his home country. Fleeing with
            his family to the United States as a child, he later became a
            doctor, but his passion for writing led him to craft tales that
            resonated deeply with readers worldwide. His debut novel, "The Kite
            Runner" (2003), catapulted him to literary fame. Set against the
            backdrop of Soviet and Taliban rule in Afghanistan, it tells the
            heartbreaking story of two young boys, Amir and Hassan, bound by an
            unbreakable friendship tragically tested by betrayal and violence.
            Hosseini's subsequent novels, "A Thousand Splendid Suns" (2007) and
            "And the Mountains Echoed" (2013), further solidified his reputation
            as a master storyteller. Both novels delve into the lives of Afghan
            women, chronicling their resilience and suffering amidst war,
            cultural restrictions, and personal struggles. Through his evocative
            prose and nuanced characters, Hosseini brings to life the realities
            of a nation scarred by conflict, yet never devoid of hope and
            humanity. Hosseini's novels have earned him numerous awards and
            widespread acclaim, translated into over 40 languages and adapted
            into successful films.
